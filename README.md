# Keep Stake Pooling

***
## 【Introduction of Keep Stake Pooling】
- This is a smart contract for the Keep Stake Pooling.
 
- Keep Stake Pooling is that:
  - set up a system to allow smaller Keep owners to delegate a stake lower than the current minimum Keep stake. 
  - It can be combined with others to reach the current minimum stake and run a node. 
  - Contributions building on said work will also be accepted specifically reducing the min stake amount below 20k into the pool or making it non custodial.
